# Overview

This Terraform module manages GitHub Actions environment variables and secrets for a specified repository and environment. It sets essential variables such as the Azure Subscription ID, Entra ID Tenant and Client IDs, and conditionally includes a client secret if provided. By automating the configuration of these environment-specific settings, the module ensures secure and consistent management of credentials and configuration values for your GitHub Actions workflows.
